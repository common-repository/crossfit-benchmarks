**Change Log:**

**Version 0.4:** changed the name of the plugin 

**Version 0.3:** some quick fixes

* this WP subversion repository did some funky things to my paths... had to fix the code so the plugin wouldn't break
* changed the default custom workout category back to what it should be: null

**Version 0.2:** first public release

* added "custom" workout category
* fixed CSS for compatibility with more themes
* added CSS options, including using a custom CSS file
* fixed user level permissions

**Version 0.1:** beta version, not for the faint of heart.  Special thanks to Kris M and Justin R for their feedback.

The simplest and fastest way to install this plugin is to use the built-in plugin installer that comes with WordPress.
